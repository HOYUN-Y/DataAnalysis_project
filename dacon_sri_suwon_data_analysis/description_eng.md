Overview

In recent years, the importance of data-driven policymaking and scientific decision-making has been increasingly emphasized in the field of public administration. Especially for local governments, addressing complex social issues that are closely connected to citizens’ daily lives requires quantitative analysis and empirical approaches. Utilizing public and private data enables a more objective and precise understanding of regional challenges and supports the development of effective policy alternatives.

In line with this shift, Suwon City aims to incorporate private-sector data analysis capabilities into its policymaking process, promote the practical use of research data held by academic institutions, and foster an environment where community members can actively participate in policy design.

The SRI Data Competition seeks to discover creative and actionable ideas that address Suwon City’s policy issues through data-driven analysis.

This competition goes beyond simple idea submissions. It will serve as an open platform for collaborative policy experimentation, engaging citizens, researchers, and data professionals alike. Participants are invited to propose data-backed policy solutions that contribute to Suwon City’s sustainable development and enhance the quality of urban life.
